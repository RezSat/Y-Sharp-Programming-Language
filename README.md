# python <Y#/Y-sharp>
Hello I am Yehan Wasura, 16 years old for 2020 and this is my one of the best project and this is my own programming language written in Python. The main Intetion of this programming language is for building an easier environment for Robotic Engineers and Computer Automation, but this project doesn't carry those things currently, I hope to develope this upto that level. 

Please Contribute to This Project if you can.


(Linux/Unix)command : python3 main.py test.yshp(filename with extension)

Windows : 
```
[1] (Only if you need to run Y# from anywhere, otherwise skip this step and just open the cmd inside the bin folder and copy all ysharp files to bin folder and start to run by the command mentioned in the 3rd step )

Copy the path of Y#.exe file and add it to environment variables
   ex : if you download my repository to the C drive then y#.exe will be on C:/bin/ file just copy the path to the bin file and goto search bar and search for environment variables and new the variable "path" add new path (then add the path of the y#.exe)
   
[2] Then make a new file 'ex: file.yshp' or use the tests file given.

[3] open command prompt there and type : y# file.yshp and press enter that's all you are done

ex: open cmd inside the bin folder:
            cmd : y# examples/test.yshp

```

I thought of rebuilding this project with c language beacuse python is slow, my ultimate objectives are:
  ```
  ** To add more Built-in functions like "speak function and more so then it's easy for programmers to get voice from computer without much coding.I think of doing this because that this programming language is mainly building for Robotic engineering and Computer Automation **
  
  **I thought od developing this programming language such a way that python code also can use in the same yshp code like html can use css and javascript**
  
  ** I thought of developing a my own hardawre like Arduino with the control of my programming language, beacuse of my main intention**
  ```
