A programming language written in Python. Just For Fun

Contribute to This Project if you like. 

## New Issues Fixed
`[*] Not printing integer variables in the ouput console - Released Version (1.0.1)`

(Linux/Unix)command : python3 main.py test.yshp(filename with extension)

Windows : 
```
[1] (Only if you need to run Y# from anywhere, otherwise skip this step and just open the cmd inside the bin folder and copy all ysharp files to bin folder and start to run by the command mentioned in the 3rd step )

Copy the path of Y#.exe file and add it to environment variables
   ex : if you download my repository to the C drive then y#.exe will be on C:/bin/ file just copy the path to the bin file and goto search bar and search for environment variables and new the variable "path" add new path (then add the path of the y#.exe)
   
[2] Then make a new file 'ex: file.yshp' or use the tests file given.

[3] open command prompt there and type : y# file.yshp and press enter that's all you are done

ex: open cmd inside the bin folder:
            cmd : y# examples/test.yshp

```

I thought of rebuilding this project with c language beacuse python is slow,
